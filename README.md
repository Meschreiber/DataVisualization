# DataVisualization
Udacity Unit on d3.js &amp; dimple.js

## Summary 

This visualization shows the demographics of 891 of the 1317 passengers aboard the Titanic.  This dataset is taken from [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?train.csv#) website.  I cleaned the data by removing categories I was uninterested in (passenger name, cabin number, fare) and creating a new one which combined the number of spouses/siblings and parents/children abroad.

## Design 

My inital idea is to move progressively through the data from simple to more complex. The first set of visualizations will simply show the breakdown of theses passengers in terms of gender, age, ticket class (first, second, or third class), port of embarkment, and number of family members abroad.  Second, will focus on survivorship, first by showing the total number of survivors and non survivors and then breaking down the original visualization into these categories.  Finally, the visualization will show each of these categories as percentages rather than raw numbers.  Finally, I would like users to be able to select certain demographics (First class, single, female, in her 20s, embarked in Southampton) and see what the survival rate for that particular demographic is.
