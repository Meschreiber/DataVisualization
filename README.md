# DataVisualization
Udacity Unit on d3.js &amp; dimple.js

## Summary 
This visualization shows the demographics of 891 of the 1317 passengers aboard the Titanic. Specifically, gender, class, port of embarkment, age, and number of family members aboard were explored. There were more men than women, more third class passengers than first class, and the most common age range was between 21 - 30.  Next, survivorhsip within each of these categories was explored.  Unsurprisingly, women, children, and first class passengers were more likely to survive.

## Design 

### Dataset information
This dataset is taken from [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?train.csv#) website.  I cleaned the data by removing categories I was uninterested in (passenger name, cabin number, fare) and creating a new one which combined the number of spouses/siblings and parents/children abroad and a new one which put passengers into age "bins".

### Version 1
My inital idea is to move progressively through the data from simple to more complex. The first set of visualizations will simply show the breakdown of theses passengers in terms of gender, age, ticket class (first, second, or third class), port of embarkment, and number of family members abroad.  Second, will focus on survivorship, first by showing the total number of survivors and non survivors and then breaking down the original visualization into these categories.  Finally, the visualization will show each of these categories as percentages rather than raw numbers.  In the future, I would like users to be able to select certain demographics (First class, single, female, in her 20s, embarked in Southampton) and see what the survival rate for that particular demographic is.
